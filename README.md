## Description

This is the Petfull fullstack project.

The user can input their name on the landing page and be added to a queue to adopt from a list of imaginary animals. The user will then be taken to a page that displays the queue of adopters and the cat and dog that are currently available. Once the user's name is at the front of the queue, the user will be given the option to adopt one of the two available pets.
